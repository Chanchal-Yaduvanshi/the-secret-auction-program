# the-secret-auction-program
This Python script allows users to participate in a secret auction by entering their name and bid amount. Then script determines the highest bidder and announces the winner.

**How it Works**

The find_highest_bid function takes a bidding record as input and iterates through it to find the highest bid and the corresponding bidder.
User Interaction:
User bids are stored in a dictionary, with names as keys and bid amounts as values.
Users are asked if there are any other bidders. If yes, the process continues; if no, the highest bidder is determined and announced using the find_highest_bidÂ function.
